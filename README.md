# üß† DMA Toolkit ‚Äì All-in-One Web-Based DMA Utility Platform

**DMA Toolkit** is a modern, web-first platform that simplifies and automates the entire workflow of working with **Direct Memory Access (DMA)** setups ‚Äî from device flashing to speed testing. It provides users with a clean, intuitive UI while offering powerful backend and agent-driven features, eliminating the need for complex local setup and CLI gymnastics.

---

## üöÄ What It Is

DMA Toolkit is a **full-stack platform** designed to centralize every DMA-related action through a **browser-based interface**, supported by a lightweight **local companion agent** for hardware-level tasks.

It removes the need to manually configure DMA tools, juggle binaries, or debug in the dark ‚Äî the browser becomes your control center.

## üñ•Ô∏è Intended Use Cases

- Flash DMA devices across different platforms
- Benchmark performance for different hardware setups
- Provide user-friendly setup for DMA newcomers
- Troubleshoot DMA driver/firmware issues through UI
- Encourage community collaboration via a built-in forum

---

## ‚ö° Project Philosophy

> "DMA installation can be hard ‚Äî but it doesn't have to be. I am building a bridge between raw hardware control and intuitive UI to make the lives of many DMA newcomers easier."  
> ‚Äì *Paradox.*

DMA Toolkit aims to revolutionize how we interface with hardware ‚Äî not by simplifying capabilities, but by simplifying access to them.

## üîê Licensing

- Open source under the **MIT License**
- Encouraged for hobbyist, educational, and even professional use
- Companion agent is auditable and built with security in mind (minimal local privileges)
